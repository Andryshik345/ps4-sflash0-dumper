# PS4 Sflash0 NOR Dump Payload

This payload was made for dumping NOR firmware (so called Sflash0) to USB drive instead using FTP.

The compiled PS4 payload is available for download in the [release section](https://github.com/Andryshik345/ps4-sflash0-dumper/releases/).

## How to compile for PS4

1. Set up the PS4 payload SDK from https://github.com/Scene-Collective/ps4-payload-sdk.
2. In the ps4-sflash0-dumper directory: `make clean && make` to compile.

Thanks zecoxao for the initial idea.
